.logfire has credentials. Even though it is protected by .gitignore, I should fine a better way
find a CLI way to deploy to railway. That way parameters can be passed from repository
create a script like "go project a" and that should do things like uv sync etc.
Is Railway.toml still required
Flake other targets seem to be hard coded for research-auditor.  What is the general way to fix it
get in the habit of feature branch development and merge to main and publish from main method. Talk to LLM to get comfortable
ship-registry to trigger only after verify source completes
verify source should run not only on push to main but also for any v* tags
